The dataset I used is California's Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages from data.gov (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/quarterly-census-of-employment-and-wages-qcew). The index.Rmd file has a command that will download the file (it is too large at over 500 MB to upload onto Github).
It can be downloaded using the following link:
