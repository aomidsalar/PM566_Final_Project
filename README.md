My PM566 Final Project examines wage fluctuations from the years 2004 to 2020 throughout California, within the education sector, and within colleges and universities. The dataset I used came from California's Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages from data.gov (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/quarterly-census-of-employment-and-wages-qcew).
